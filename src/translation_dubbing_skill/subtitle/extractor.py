"""Extract the embedded English subtitle track from a video file.

This module provides :func:`extract_from_video`, which shells out to
``ffmpeg`` to pull the first stream tagged with ``language=eng`` out of
the container and emit it as SRT on stdout.

Design notes
------------

- We invoke ``ffmpeg`` once with
  ``-map 0:s:m:language:eng -c:s srt -f srt -``. The ``-map`` selector
  chooses the first subtitle stream whose ``language`` metadata tag is
  ``eng``; if none exists, ``ffmpeg`` fails with a non-zero exit code.
- ``-c:s srt`` re-encodes whatever the source codec is (``mov_text``,
  ``webvtt``, ``subrip``, ...) to plain SubRip so the caller always sees
  a consistent SRT payload. The returned format literal is therefore
  always ``"srt"``.
- ``ffmpeg`` is invoked with ``-y`` (overwrite) for safety even though we
  stream to stdout; ``-nostdin`` guarantees we never block on a prompt.
- Any failure — missing track, invalid container, ``ffmpeg`` not on
  PATH, timeout — is normalized to :class:`NoEnglishSubtitleError`
  carrying the video path and (when available) the tail of the ``ffmpeg``
  stderr for operator debugging.

Corresponds to requirements R2.6 and R2.7.

    Args:

    Returns:
        A ``(text, format)`` pair. ``text`` is the subtitle content encoded
        as UTF-8 SRT; ``format`` is always the literal ``"srt"`` because
        ``ffmpeg`` is asked to normalize whatever source codec the track
        uses into SubRip.

        NoEnglishSubtitleError: the container carries no English subtitle
            stream, ``ffmpeg`` is not available on PATH, the subprocess
            timed out, or the extraction otherwise failed. The error's
            ``context`` includes ``video_path`` and a bounded tail of the
            ``ffmpeg`` stderr output when one was captured.
